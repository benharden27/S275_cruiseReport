\section*{Data Description}

This report summarizes the science activities aboard the \textit{SSV Robert C. Seamans} during the Sea Education Association's Fall 2017 semester ''Sustainability in Polynesian Island Cultures and Ecosystems'' (SPICE), cruise S275. This cruise departed Pago Pago, in American Samoa on 28th September 2017 and concluded in Auckland on 6th November 2017. En route, the Seamans had port calls in Neiafu in the Vava'u island group of Tonga (4--7 Oct), in Nuku'alofa the Tongan Capital in the southern Tongatapu island group (11--14th Oct), and in Suva, Fiji (19--23 Oct). On the leg between American Samoa and the Vava'u, we crossed the international date line. The 1st October was skipped and our clocks went from midnight at the end of the 30th September to midnight at the end of the 1st October.

\label{cruiseTrack}
\end{figure}

The cruise track spanned a range of oceanographic environments. We transited from the the tropics in American Samoa to the temperate mid-latitudes around New Zealand's North Island, crossing the western side of the south Pacific Gyre en route. We also had the opportunity to sampled across the transition from near-shore to open ocean as we transited through the Tongan and Fijian region.

The 21 students of S275 were all active and responsible for data collection in the lab. Although this particular semester program is science-lite in it's focus, students all undertook small research projects pertaining to the ocean data collected. In addition to investigations of physical, chemical and biological properties along the whole cruise track, the two addional key topics of investigation were the Island Mass Effect and Ocean Soundscapes.

To accomplish our science goals our sampling plan included:

\begin{itemize}
  \item A standard SEA portfolio of noon CTD casts, twice-daily Neuston tows, and continuous measurements from ADCP, Chirp and flow-through system;
 \item Surface and subsurface samples for extracted chlorophyll-a, Nitrate, Phosphate and pH. This included high-resolution surface stations approaching and/or leaving port to probe run-off. We also conducted hydrocasts upstream and downstream of islands to investigate island upwelling.
 \item Noon hydrophone deployments (outlined below).
 \item Day-time, hourly 6-minute observations of fauna and debris.
 \item Occasional midnight CTD casts.
 \item Occasional midnight Meter-Net tows to approximately 200 m.
 \item Occasional RBR-CTD towed deployments (outlined below).
 \item Filtering for Microplastics from water samples.
\end{itemize} 

The winds for this cruise were predominantly from an easterly direction (Figure \ref{winds}) and presented little in the way of obstruction to our movement along the cruise track. The easterlies were maintained all the way to New Zealand. In the previous year (S269), the winds had been from a more south-easterly direction before transitioning to westerlies south of 30$^{\circ}$S. As a result, the cruise track heading southward from Fiji this year was much mire direct. S269's cruise track tended more westward before returning eastward to New Zealand. For the second half of the long passage to New Zealand, the winds were sustained strong with large seas. As a result, we undertook limited sampling south of 30$^{\circ}$S, instead opting to make the most of the winds in moving us towards our destination.

This summary of the data is not meant to be exhaustive; lengthy data sets from, for example, ADCP, CTDs, or CHIRP, have not been included in their entirety. All data is available and can be requested from the SEA data archivist.

\subsection*{Hydrophone Deployments}
Part of our standard sampling during this cruise was noon hydrophone deployments. This was motivated partly by our proximity to humpback whale breeding grounds in Tonga and partly by a desire from SEA faculty to expand our capabilities in this area given our relatively quiet vessels.

The hydrophone was streamed from the port-side of the quarter deck while the Seamans was hove-to. Our standard protecol was to make 30-minute recordings on a TASCAM audio recorder. However, some deployments varied in length. During the hydrophone deployment we undertook visual surveys of ships and marine mammals.

Two notable deployments were stations 16 and 38 on the 8 Oct and 27 Oct respectively.

During station 16 we were in the shallow breeding grounds of humpback whales in Tonga. During the recording (which was approximately 1hr20m long) we saw numerous whales displaying a range of behaviours. This recording is our best record of humpback whale song along our cruise track.

During station 38 we conducted an experiment into the soundscape of the Seamans itself. We systematically secured machinery aboard the ship to isolate the sounds that each produced. This included a short period (approximately 30 seconds) of black-shop when all engineering equipment was secured. The meta data for this experiment is recorded in the SEA Archive.

\subsection*{RBR-CTD towed deployments}

We experimented with deploying the RBR-CTD on a towable wing during this cruise. This was deployed from the BT winch on the starboard quarter and was towed in a saw-tooth configuration while the ship was in transit. The goal of this deployment was to investigate small-scale structures in the vertical and horizontal around island regions that could be indicative of eddy shedding or localized upwelling.

We deployed four times, once in the open ocean between American Samoa and Tonga, twice around the island group of Vava'u (one upstream, one downstream) and once south of Vava'u as we moved from the shallow shelf region (approx. 100m) to the deep ocean. An example is presented in Figure \ref{CTD_RBR}.

The salinity data from these casts is suspect in comparison with Seabird CTD data at nearby casts (Figure \ref{CTD_RBR}). This is not necessarily surprising. The RBR module is an older model made before the company moved to improve the flow through the induction cell. The flow over the towable wing might also be mixing and trapping water pockets thereby also creating issues with the data collected. The data below is presented as-is and should be considered not quality controlled.

\subsection*{Additional Data Notes}

\begin{itemize}
 \item One event file was maintained for the duration of the cruise (ELG 002)
 \item The author suspects that the ADCP data exported by the onboard system and recorded in the ODV text files in our archive is probably not accurate. There are occasions when the current direction appears correlated to the ships heading and so can't be considered physical. This needs further investigation and is the reason why no ADCP data is shown in this report. As of writing, this ADCP data in the SEA archive should be not used without consideration of this quality issue.
 \item Please request the end of cruise report for full technical details of ship science operations.

CTD stations 8 and 10 (Seabird CTDs) were undertaken at either end of the RBR tow period and are appended to the record for the sake of this figure. Only the downcast of the RBR deployment were used for this plot (of which there were 8). As can be seen, the Seabird CTD data doesn't necessarily match well with that of the RBR. There were three more deployments of the RBR in this manner.}
